# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 
Create an user account at OpenWeather to obtain the app ID.
Create a file named .env with the following code and your app ID.
## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

Entering a zip code will fire an api call to OpenWeatherMap to fetch some data including: temperature, city, small description about the weather.
All made by fetch methods GET and POST, and javascript promises.
